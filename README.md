# Jeopardy Project
I wanted to recreate an authentic jeopardy game with my own spin on it.

# Instructions
Select a dollar amount below one of the categories. Buzz in with the correct response to win that amount, or a wrong response will subtract the amount.

There are Daily Doubles placed at random on the board. Only the player who selects a SPECIAL may answer it. Prior to answering, they must make a wager. The minimum wager is $5 and the maximum wager is the amount they have accumulated in the bank.

Player 1 uses Q to buzz in
Player 2 uses P to buzz in

* Choose Theme
* Insert name of Player 1
    * Player 1 uses Q to buzz in
* Insert name of Player 2
    * Player 2 uses P to buzz in
* Begin game

# Overview
You will have 15 seconds to respond to each clue. At the end of each 15-second interval, whatever has been typed into the screen will be captured. Do not respond in the form of a question. When the test is over you will be able to compare your responses with the correct responses.
